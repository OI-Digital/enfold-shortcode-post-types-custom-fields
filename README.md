# Create a custom Enfold shortcode (testimonial slider) to pull a custom post type with Advanced Custom Fields data

CPT = testimonials

ACF = 'name' txt field

You need to be using the Enfold child-theme. The custom shortcodes go into /wp-content/themes/enfold-child/shortcodes/

This new shortcode was based on /enfold/config-templatebuilder/avia-shortcodes/testimonials/testimonials.php
